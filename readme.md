# Task Nagger for "Remember the Milk"

It adds nagging abilities to RTM - Consistenly reminding you of due tasks and preventing you from forgetting.

## Requirements

This currently works only for the new UI of Remember The Milk, available only for pro members - If your UI is different from the picture, it will not work.

If you'd like a version for the older version, open an issue for that or submit a PR.

## Features

* Choose a list to nag you about
* Blink a badge with the nubmer of pending tasks, when they are due - Postpone or complete the tasks to stop the blinking

## Installation

Download and run the [latest release](https://github.com/vitalybe/task-nagger-2/releases). 

A version for mac can be build from source. *Note:* Was not tested on Mac - Should work, but might not*
